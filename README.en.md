# Graph-CPP

This is a small project of mine from some years ago, in C++ language, which I made while studying
about graphs.

Basically, the code implements the undirected graph of the pic below, do the visiting of its nodes
by Breadth- (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms and applies the Shortest Path Algorithm
(aka Dijkstra's Algorithm).

## Build

`make` or `make all` or `make grafo-cpp`

## Run

`./grafo-cpp`
