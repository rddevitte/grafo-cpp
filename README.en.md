# Graph-CPP

This is a small project of mine from some years ago, in C++ language, which I made while studying about graphs. Haven't touched much the source code ever since.

Basically, the code implements the undirected graph of the pic below, do the visiting of its nodes by breadth- and depth-first search and applies the shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm).

## Compiling

## Run
