# Graph in C++

This is a small project of mine from some years ago, in C++ language, which I made while studying
about graphs.

Basically, the code implements the undirected graph of the pic below, do the visiting on its nodes
by Breadth- (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, list the components of the graph and
its vertices and applies the Shortest Path Algorithm (aka &ldquo;Dijkstra's Algorithm&rdquo;).

## Build

`make` or `make all` or `make grafo-cpp`

## Run

`./grafo-cpp`
